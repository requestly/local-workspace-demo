Pipedrive’s v1 API has been constantly evolving, but it is still based on the same foundations that were laid a long time ago. Pipedrive as a company has grown a lot since then and it is time to reflect that in our API as well. Hence, we are announcing a gradual transition to a new v2 version of our API.

The new v2 API comes with many benefits such as

-   a lot less breaking changes;
-   lower  [rate limiter token costs](https://pipedrive.readme.io/docs/core-api-concepts-rate-limiting#token-based-rate-limiting)  per endpoint;
-   significantly better performance and response times, especially when iterating over large data sets;
-   consistent and predictable behavior with compliance with REST best practices;
-   better data quality due to stricter input validation.
